When I´m not trying to develop my photography skills, I´m practicing sketching. I´m pretty much a beginner and hope to get improve over time. Now, sometimes I like to join both types of creativity and make something out of it so here are a bunch of drawings that I made by using photo references that I took myself.

## 1.Sparrow

This photo is one of my favorites. I caught this cute sparrow during sunset, which is the golden hour due to the quality of the lighting. It might not be perfect. But still, I glad I got the pose right at least.

## 2.White Wagtail

This is [a wagtail](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/white-wagtail), due to its tendency to wag its tail. A very common bird here in Europe. I took this one in during my visit to Spain. I love them, they´re actually one of my favorites. I was really lucky to get a picture up close.

I like to think I got the pattern right.

## 3.Eurasian Skylark

I caught this  [Euroasian Skylark (_Alauda arvensis)_](https://ebird.org/species/skylar) at a beach. Its coloring allows it to blend in with its surroundings. it has a very characteristic song. I love this bird because of the plumage at the top of its head, making it looks like it has a spiked hairstyle.. I tried my best to capture its likeness, although the beak might be a bit longer than it´s real-life counterpart.

So this is pretty much all the drawings I made far. As you can see, I still have a lot to learn about animal sketching, but I enjoyed the process and learning more about these birds. If I feel more confident I might post more of my art here, if only to show off my progress.
